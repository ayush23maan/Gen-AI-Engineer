#  Goal 
To become a strong candidate for the "GenAI Engineer / Applied Data Scientist" profile.

# Plan
Solidify Your Tier 1 Foundation:

Master LangChain: Don't just read about it. Build multiple projects. Our plan to build a RAG application on your Google Search history is a perfect portfolio project.

Build Your Project: As we planned, build the RAG application on your search data. But now, add these steps:

Step A: Ingest your data and build the RAG logic.

Step B: Wrap your RAG logic in a FastAPI application. Create an endpoint where you can send a query and get a response.

Step C: Containerize this FastAPI app using Docker.

Step D (Bonus): Deploy this Docker container to a free-tier service on AWS or Azure.

Completing this project will allow you to tick off Python, LangChain, RAG, FastAPI, Docker, and Cloud experience in an interview.

Learn Basic Fine-Tuning (Tier 2):

Once your RAG project is done, find a small, interesting dataset (e.g., a dataset of movie summaries and genres).

Use Google Colab to fine-tune a small open-source model like Mistral-7B to get better at classifying movie genres from summaries. This demonstrates a deeper level of understanding.

Tailor Your Resume:

Use the exact keywords from these job descriptions: "RAG," "LangChain," "LLM," "Fine-tuning," "FastAPI," "Docker," "AWS."

Frame your projects using this language. Instead of "a tool to search my history," say "Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain and FAISS, deployed as a REST API with FastAPI and Docker."

Your path is clear. Focus on becoming a builder. The market for people who can connect these powerful models to real-world applications using frameworks like LangChain and deploy them is growing rapidly and is very accessible for a motivated beginner.

# Project
Ask questions about your past Google searches and get answers based on the information you found at the time. It's like having a personalized search engine that understands your interests and can quickly retrieve relevant information from your search history.
